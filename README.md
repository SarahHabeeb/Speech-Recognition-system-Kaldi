 The Automatic speech recognition (ASR) system is one of most important
technologies that used for human-machine interaction. The main goal of the ASR system
is to recognize different natural languages that are spoken by humans. The difficulties of
these recognition systems depend on many factors, such as noises, variability of the
speakers, and problems of continuous speech. For that reason, many researchers and
foundations have designed different kinds of licensed toolkits and software that are
specialized in building speech recognition systems, including , Julius, Sphinx-4, RWTH
ASR, and HTK toolkits.

 In this thesis, Kaldi toolkit, which is one of the most notable speech recognition
tools that is written in C++ and released under the Apache License v2.0, is used to build,
train, and evaluate a digital ASR system. First, the speech recognition system has been
explained in detail and built using the TIDIGITS corpus. Second, different training
approaches(including discriminative training methods) have been studied and applied to
improve the accuracy of the speech recognition system.

The ASR system accuracy has been evaluated using two evolution metrics: the
word error rate(WER) and the sentence error rate (SER). The overall obtained system
performance is ranged from 99.05% to 99.55% depending on the training methods that
have been applied.
